# Class holiday accounter

This program was made to take holidays into account of a college class course program.
Fill out the template `ClassesConfiguration.csv` and run the program to get an output with all the dates, days, and the class for that day in a new `output.csv`.

## Creating an executable

run `pyinstaller -F ./main.py`
